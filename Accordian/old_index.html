               <p> SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a programming language used to communicate with relational databases. The acronym is pronounced like the word sequel, but some people will just use the three letters S, Q, and L.

               <p> Programming skills, or coding skills, are the skills we use to write instructions for computers, applications, or software. They include different programming languages and concepts. What skills do I need to code? To start, you'll need knowledge of at least one programming language.

            <p>No, coding isn't hard to learn, but it isn't a walk in the park either. It can be a steep hill to climb at firstâ€”but you'll likely surprise yourself by how much you can learn. As you progress, learning to code becomes easier. The key to success is not giving up on the early stages
